This simple Calender app is a Week 4 Homework Task


## Description

The simple calender app offers a Work day scheduler in the form of a daily planner.
This allows the user to plan their day.
When the individual opens their daily planner they are presented with the current date at the top. 
They are then offered hourly timeslots in which to book meetings and activities.



## Functionality

the planner identifies identifies the current timeslot and differentiates this from the past and future timeslots by colour;

- Red   = Current Hour Timeslot
- Grey  = Past Hour Timeslots
- Green = Future Timeslots


```
 * When the user presses the saved button their appointment is available to view when they return to the planner at a later time.

 ```
